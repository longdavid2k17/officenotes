# OfficeNotes Â®
Free and advanced document editor, kinda OpenOffice, MS Word and all of this stuff. No need to pay, no more nonintuitial menu bars (ofc it's very personal point of view). It's less memorytaking than OpenOffice, more advanced than notepad, and free in oposite of MS Word.

IMPORTANT - PROJECTS IS FINISHED, BUT STILL SOME FEATURES COULD NOT WORK - FOR EXAMPLE EDITED TEXT IS NOT SAVING IN THE SAME STATE INTO FILE!

# Prerequisites
You don't need to install external software, all you need is JAVA. Link to the final .jar file on the bottom of file ;)

# Getting Started

How you can see, controlling this software is easy and simple. Most used function are in the most common places (like File Menu).
Just open file and start writting like Sheakspere
