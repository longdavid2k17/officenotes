# opendocs Â®
Free and advanced document editor, kinda OpenOffice, MS Word and all of this stuff. No need to pay, no more nonintuitial menu bars (ofc it's very personal point of view). It's less memorytaking than OpenOffice, more advanced than notepad, and free in oposite of MS Word.

IMPORTANT - SOFTWARE IN DEVELOPMENT. STILL SOME FEATURES COULD NOT WORK!

PS: First production name was OfficeNotes but the name was too similar to MS product

# Prerequisites
You don't need to install external software, all you need is JAVA ;)

# Getting Started
It's what main screen looks like.

How you can see, controlling this software is easy and simple. Most used function are in the most common places (like File Menu).
Just open file and start writting like Sheakspere

You can simply format your's text - change color, font family, font size, and align it to left or right.

OpenDocs brings you printing support and exporting to PDF (for now, edited text can be exported just to print format. still working on this).
